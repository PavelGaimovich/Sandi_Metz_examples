Sandi Metz OOP design examples.
=======================================================
Book: Practical Object oriented design for Ruby by Sandi Metz.
-------------------------------------------------------
Fascinating book. Open eyes on OOP, showing bold line between Ruby vs other OOP languages,
at same time: telling about true power of OOP and how you can use it in practice.
Examples are very clear for understanding.

Some favorite cases from book I interpreted in my way.
